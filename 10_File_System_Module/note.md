File Flags: When opening files, you can specify different modes:
'w'  - Open for writing (file is created or truncated)
'wx' - Like 'w' but fails if the path exists
'w+' - Open for reading and writing (file is created or truncated)
'a'  - Open for appending (file is created if it doesn't exist)
'ax' - Like 'a' but fails if the path exists
'r+' - Open for reading and writing (file must exist)
